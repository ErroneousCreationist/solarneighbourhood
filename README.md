# Solar Neighbourhood Planet Pack
# By SocialistCoconut (discord name)
A planet pack depicting the solar neighbourhood seen in Echoes Of The Eye! Includes the Strangers Homeworld and the other strange places! And, a recent discovery by the Outer Wilds Ventures, a strange anomaly around the Attlerock! Maybe Esker will finally stop being lonely! Enough said, go explore the SOLAR NEIGHBOURHOOD!
